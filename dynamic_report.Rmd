# A small survey of the different habits of people on YouTube

Note: Considering that I do not know a lot of people the data collected is barely sufficient for making a thorough analysis but considering the diverse responses I got I will try my best to make it relevant to the subjected survey.


## Collecting Data

From the Google Form survey given those are the responses received.
As we can see form a population of 22 people concerning their habits on YouTube.<br>
The important data to note are: <br>
<ul>
  <li style="font-family: "Roboto", sans-serif;" >When people are on YouTube</li>
  <li style="font-family: "Roboto", sans-serif;">Hours per week spent on YouTube</li>
  <li style="font-family: "Roboto", sans-serif;">Contents type</li>
</ul>
Moreover, we also have to consider the type of contents they are watching.
As shown below we have the type of contents but not the percentage and finding the frequency of the data above would troublesome.
```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(magick)

csv_link <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQGQA6wiMra1VqA2EYs5IVHi5Gm8_sREWCw6Jt4thncOpya-U24h3dgVVhev79AcBUB-LWcdwAjV_eM/pub?output=csv"

logged_data <- read.csv(csv_link)

# renaming for better experience
logged_data <- logged_data %>%
  rename("When on YouTube"= How.often.do.you.watch.YouTube.) %>%
  rename("Time of entry" = Timestamp) %>%
  rename("H/w spent on YT" = How.many.hours.per.week.do.you.spend.watching.YouTube.) %>%
  rename("Contents type" = What.type.of.contents.do.you.prefer.watching.on.YouTube.)

# view and check the structure of the file
logged_data %>% slice(1:n())


#####################################################

# The R code above represents the data
# The 3 charts are: 
# a pie chart representing the YT watchtime frequency,
# a graph representing 
# a graph representing  
#
# The summary value YT_time_average represents the percentage of frequency
# and how responses are distributed, feels pertinent to know the frequency 
# people go on YT to correlate with the second summary value
# The summary value YT_per_week_summary represents the hours people go on YT
# pertinent because if we cross them with the response we could make a 
# deduction that people who have a higher than average watchtime are more likely
# to spend time daily on YT


```
## Modeling the data entry

Let's make some charts to represent our data and some observation



<table>
  <tr>
    <td style="width: 50%;">
```{r}
# pie chart of YT frequency watch time
frequency_watchtime <- 
  ggplot(logged_data, aes(x = "", y = `H/w spent on YT`, fill = `When on YouTube`)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1) +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  labs(title = "YouTube Watching Frequency", fill = "Frequency") +
  theme_void()
print(frequency_watchtime)


```
    </td>
    <td style="width: 50%; vertical-align: top;">
      <br><p>This pie chart represents the frequency of YouTube watch time.  
      As we can see there are a lot of people watching YouTube on a daily basis and small minority that watch it sparsely.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td style="width:50%;">
```{r}
# chart for correlation between frequency and hours spent per week on YT
frequency_hours <- ggplot(logged_data, aes(x = `When on YouTube`, y = `H/w spent on YT`, fill = `When on YouTube`)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "YouTube Watching Frequency vs. Hours Spent per Week",
       x = "Watch Frequency", 
       y = "Hours per Week") +
  theme_minimal()
print(frequency_hours)


```
    </td>
    <td style="width: 50%; vertical-align: top;">
      <br><p>This chart represents the correlation between the watch time frequency and the hours spent on the app.  
      As we can see, even though the data is not large enough, people who spend time daily on YouTube have a higher time spent.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>


<table>
  <tr>
    <td style="width:50%;">
```{r}
# chart for correlation with content types and hours per week spent
content_per_hours <- ggplot(logged_data, aes(x = `Contents type`,
                                             y = `H/w spent on YT`,
                                             fill = `Contents type`)) + 
  geom_violin() + 
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(title = "YouTube Content type Vs Hours spent", x = "Content type", y = "Hours per week") +
  theme_minimal()
print(content_per_hours)

```
    </td>
    <td style="width: 50%; vertical-align: top;">
      <br><p>This chart represents the  between the type of contents watched and the hours people spent on the application.  
      The data set is not large enough and therefore no helpful observation could be made with this chart except that the contents are pretty diverse.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Summary values

Let's take a look at the summary values that seemed relevant with the chart and our observations.<br>
<br>
Firstly, now that we have the numbers, as we can see below and have discussed in the pie chart above, there are 72% (16) of people who spent their time daily on the application.

```{r}
# summary value for usage of YT (not in hours)
YT_time_average <- logged_data %>%
  count(`When on YouTube`) %>%
  mutate(Percentage = (n / sum(n)) * 100)
print(YT_time_average)
```

<p>Moreover, the more recurrent contents are Gaming, Music videos, Vlogs and Sketches.And this percentage below would be the percentage of the contents type.</p>


```{r}
# 
# gives the min, max, median of watch time per week
YT_per_week_summary <- summary(logged_data$`H/w spent on YT`)

# percentage of content summary
# summary of the type of contents people watch
content_summary <- logged_data %>%
  count(`Contents type`) %>%
  mutate(Percentage = (n / sum(n)) * 100)
print(content_summary)
```

## Observation 

Based on the (small) data taken we can make some observations.<br>

<ul>
  <li style="font-family: "Roboto", sans-serif;" >People who watch YouTube daily are more likely to who have a higher watch time and hours spent on the application, which should be obvious.</li>
  <li style="font-family: "Roboto", sans-serif;">There seems to be a trend of watching gaming, music videos, vlogs, and comedy contents</li>
</ul>
