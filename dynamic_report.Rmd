# A small survey of the different habits of people on YouTube

*Note: Considering that I do not know a lot of people, the data collected is barely sufficient for making a thorough analysis. However, considering the diverse responses I got, I will try my best to make it relevant to the survey.*

## Collecting Data

From the Google Form survey, these are the responses received.
As we can see, from a population of 22 people concerning their habits on YouTube, the important data to note are:

- **When people are on YouTube**
- **Hours per week spent on YouTube**
- **Contents type**

Moreover, we also have to consider the type of content they are watching.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(magick)

csv_link <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQGQA6wiMra1VqA2EYs5IVHi5Gm8_sREWCw6Jt4thncOpya-U24h3dgVVhev79AcBUB-LWcdwAjV_eM/pub?output=csv"

logged_data <- read.csv(csv_link)

# Renaming columns for better readability
logged_data <- logged_data %>%
  rename(
    "When on YouTube" = How.often.do.you.watch.YouTube.,
    "Time of entry" = Timestamp,
    "H/w spent on YT" = How.many.hours.per.week.do.you.spend.watching.YouTube.,
    "Contents type" = What.type.of.contents.do.you.prefer.watching.on.YouTube.
  )

# View and check the structure of the file
head(logged_data)
```

## Modeling the data entry

### YouTube Watching Frequency

```{r}
# Pie chart of YT frequency watch time
frequency_watchtime <- 
  ggplot(logged_data, aes(x = "", y = `H/w spent on YT`, fill = `When on YouTube`)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1) +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  labs(title = "YouTube Watching Frequency", fill = "Frequency") +
  theme_void()
print(frequency_watchtime)
```

As we can see, many people watch YouTube on a daily basis, while a small minority watch it sparsely.

### Correlation Between Frequency and Hours Spent per Week

```{r}
# Boxplot for frequency vs. hours spent per week on YT
frequency_hours <- ggplot(logged_data, aes(x = `When on YouTube`, y = `H/w spent on YT`, fill = `When on YouTube`)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "YouTube Watching Frequency vs. Hours Spent per Week",
       x = "Watch Frequency", 
       y = "Hours per Week") +
  theme_minimal()
print(frequency_hours)
```

Even though the dataset is small, it suggests that people who watch YouTube daily tend to spend more time on it.

### Content Type vs. Hours Spent

```{r}
# Violin plot for content type vs. hours spent on YouTube
content_per_hours <- ggplot(logged_data, aes(x = `Contents type`,
                                             y = `H/w spent on YT`,
                                             fill = `Contents type`)) + 
  geom_violin() + 
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(title = "YouTube Content Type vs. Hours Spent", x = "Content Type", y = "Hours per Week") +
  theme_minimal()
print(content_per_hours)
```

Although the dataset is small, we can see that the content preferences are diverse.

## Summary Values

Now, let's take a look at some summary statistics related to the observations above.

```{r}
# Summary of YouTube usage frequency
YT_time_average <- logged_data %>%
  count(`When on YouTube`) %>%
  mutate(Percentage = (n / sum(n)) * 100)
print(YT_time_average)
```

**Key Insight:** 72% (16 out of 22 people) reported watching YouTube daily.

```{r}
# Summary statistics of watch time per week
YT_per_week_summary <- summary(logged_data$`H/w spent on YT`)
print(YT_per_week_summary)
```

```{r}
# Summary of content preferences
content_summary <- logged_data %>%
  count(`Contents type`) %>%
  mutate(Percentage = (n / sum(n)) * 100)
print(content_summary)
```

**Popular Content Types:** Gaming, music videos, vlogs, and sketches.

## Observations

- People who watch YouTube daily tend to have a higher watch time.
- There seems to be a trend of watching gaming, music videos, vlogs, and comedy content.
